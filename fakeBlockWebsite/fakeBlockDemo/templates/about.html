			<h2 class="about-header ubuntu-font text-center">Inspiration</h2>
			<p>
				Ever since the term ‘fake news’ started floating around in 2016 United States election, I knew it was going 
				to be a big problem going forward. With the 2020 election coming up soon (at the time of making this project), 
				I decided to make an effort do something to combat this monster of a problem at one of its biggest sources, Facebook, by
				creating the FakeBlock Chrome browser extension. With this project, my goal was to create a tool, that was as politically
				unbiased as possible, to attempt to spot fake news by only the contents of a Facebook post (Truly, an impossible task. Try
				identifying fake news from only a title sometime). But, I decided to proceed with my flawed idea in order to get 
				people to notice that while on Facebook, they are constantly absorbing news: and often from a variety of sources that 
				may have less integrity than an organization with the time, money and willingness to fully investigate a story before
				passing it on. And believe me, FakeBlock will find those stories, and it may or may not flag them because it has a difficult
				job.
			</p>
			<p>
				For a single college student, this has been an enormous task and a rewarding learning experience. I hope that using
				(or even just seeing) FakeBlock helps you think more critically about where you get your news from and to remain
				critical of sensationalist news stories. While I am aware that my own efforts to tackle this problem have fallen 
				far short of the "perfect tool" mark, I hope that it may at least spark conversation and thought on the complex topics of 
				fake news and fact checking.
