# FakeBlock
A plugin to prevent Facebook users from becoming misinformed by fake news 
in their news feed by obscuring posts determined to be fake news.
Utilizing a mixture of AI and the Google fact checking API, FakeBlock
meticulously examines each post to determine its legitimacy before
allowing it to be shown to the user.
