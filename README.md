# FakeBlock
A chrome plugin to prevent Facebook users from becoming misinformed by 
their news feeds by obscuring posts determined to be fake news.
Utilizing a mixture of AI and the Google fact checking API, FakeBlock
meticulously examines each post to determine its legitimacy before
allowing it to be shown to the user.
